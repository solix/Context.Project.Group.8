Taxi Trouble is a competitive and cooperative interactive computer game which can be played by multiple teams each consisting of two players. The players of each team work together as taxi driver and navigator which together drive in a big city while avoiding other traffic, picking up customers and getting as much revenue as possible. At the same time each taxi driver is competing against the other taxi drivers to be the one to get the limited available amount of customers at their destinations. As well all taxi drivers can try to steal the customer from their competitors. One of the players of each team is the taxi driver which has only a limited view of the city, while on the other hand the other player of the team is the navigator which has a complete overview of the city and has to send his/her partner to the right directions. The winning team will be the team which made the most revenue after a short time period when the game ends.
