Our network architecture makes use of the Google Play Services API. This API sets up a peer to peer network between all clients playing the game. After establishing the peer to peer network, one of the clients is chosen to act as a server. The server will act as an authoritity, its state will be the "true" state of the game. Note that the client with the server role is still to be considered a functional client, although this client does have the advantage of playing directly on the server world. The table below lists all events that are sent over the network during normal gameplay.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | l | l | p{7cm} |}
    \hline
    Event & Sent by &  Client-side & notes\\
	  &	        & prediction  & \\ \hline
    Car movement & Client &Yes  & Car movement is send by the client driving the car. \\ \hline
    Passenger pickup / dropoff / stealing  & Server & Yes & To prevent passengers being assigned to other taxi's at the same time, only the server can send these events \\ \hline
   Powerup pickup & Server & Yes & To prevent Powerups being assigned to different teams at the same time, only the server can send this event. \\ \hline
 Powerup usage & Client & If needed  & We will implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation for powerups that are in need of this. \\ \hline
Create passenger / powerup & Server & no & New instances can only be spawned by the server, the clients should not try to predict this, as most spawning is random. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}


If an event makes use of client-side prediction, the client (visually) simulates the event before receiving the event over the network. Upon receiving the actual event, the client can finalize and/or correct the simulated event.
