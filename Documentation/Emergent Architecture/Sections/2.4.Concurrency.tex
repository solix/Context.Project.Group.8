The only real type of concurrency we have to deal with is the concurrency of incomming messages. For sending critical game data, we use GPS's reliable messaging protocol which insures delivery, integrity and correct order of receival. For sending non-critical game data (ie. The location of a taxi),  we use GPS's unreliable messaging protocol. One might wonder what happens when two messages are received in such a way that two taxis are at the same location. The LibGDX game engine will handle this as a normal collide event and correct the location of the taxis accordingly.
