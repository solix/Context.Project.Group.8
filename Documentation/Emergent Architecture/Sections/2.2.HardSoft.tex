Taxi Trouble is a real-time multi-player game where multiple users can join and interact with the game instantaneously using their Android devices. The game will start in the main menu where the user will choose whether he/she wants to start a new game or to view the leaderboard top scores of the game. When the user chooses to play a new game, he/she will get a role of either taxi driver or navigator. These roles are assigned randomly at the beginning of the match.\\
