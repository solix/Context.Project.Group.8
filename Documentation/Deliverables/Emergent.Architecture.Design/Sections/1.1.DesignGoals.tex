We have divided our classes mostly over two categories: model and view. All classes that represent the game world or objects of the game world are part of the model. All classes that construct a way to view a part of the game world are part of the view category. One of our design goals was to keep coupling between these two categories as loose as possible. This way we can easily make changes to the game world our implement a new view without having to adjust a lot of classes.
