\subsection{Design Goal: Loose Coupling}

We have divided our classes mostly over two categories: model and view. All classes that represent the game world or objects of the game world are part of the model. All classes that construct a way to view a part of the game world are part of the view category. One of our design goals was to keep coupling between these two categories as loose as possible. This way we can easily make changes to the game world our implement a new view without having to adjust a lot of classes.

\subsection{Design goal: Quality Code}

We strive for our code to have a certain level of quality. Writing good code makes it easier to expand the working prototype without having to fix emerging errors in the existing code. We want our code to approach the Exemplary Source Code Quality criteria as described in the Software Engineering Rubrics (2014).  This implies proper use of design patterns, very few design flaws and proper use of all software engineering principles.
