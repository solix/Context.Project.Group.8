At the beginning of the project we were given a problem to design a solution for. The problem was that in many
circumstances, a whole bunch of people have to stay together in the same place for a considerable amount of
time. For our project we were assigned to design a game to entertain such large groups. The requirements were
that the game must be original, creative and also let people interact with each other (e.g. verbally communicate
with each other).
At the end of each project all groups must have a document about the developed, implemented, and validated
software product. This document will provide an overview of the main functionalities of Taxi Trouble and discuss
to which extent they satisfy the needs of the user. An HCI module that was realized for the user interaction with
the developed solution will be provided as well. At the end of the document an outlook will be given regarding
the possible improvements in the future and the strategy to achieve these improvements.
