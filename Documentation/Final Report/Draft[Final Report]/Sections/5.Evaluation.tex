What we would like to include in this section is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Table with overall evaluation results from user tests.

\subsection{Evaluation of inividual functional modules}

We will now give a brief evaluation on our functional modules.

\subsubsection*{Driver Controlls}

#notes: Some people find the controlls incredibly hard, while others find them inuitive and can use them easily from the start. Probable cause is the difference in experience playing games.

\subsubsection*{Navigator Controlls}

\subsubsection*{Picking up and dropping of passengers}

\subsubsection*{Stealing Passengers}

\subsubsection*{Head Up Display}

\subsubsection*{Sound effects}

While the latency of the game is generally within playable limits, it sometimes tends to have a brief moment of increased latency, a so called "lagspike". Lagspikes are extremely anoying to the user because it makes the game feel unresponsive for a short duration. This can cause the user to fail
