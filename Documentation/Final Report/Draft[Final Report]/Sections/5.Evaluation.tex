What we would like to include in this section is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Table with overall evaluation results from user tests.
	
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{User evaluation}{
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
	\hline
	aspect & average score (1 to 5) \\ \hline
	fun & 4.25 \\ \hline
	understandabillity & 3.42 \\ \hline
	visual presentation & 4\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

The table above shows the average score for three of our most important aspects of the game. From the table it becomes apparent that most users have a good time playing the game and that a lot of them like the visual representation. However, the understandablillity of the game leaves something to be desired. Users did not know what to do at the start of the game. Some started driving, but both driver and navigator didn't know whereto they should go. After a short period of time we stepped in to explain how the game works to those who were truely lost. Many users sugested to make a short tutorial for new players. Unfortunately this tutorial has not made the current release of the game.

\subsection{Evaluation of inividual functional modules}

We will now give a brief evaluation on our functional modules.

\subsubsection*{Driver GUI}

The driver GUI consists of 

%notes: Some people find the controlls incredibly hard, while others find them inuitive and can use them easily from the start. Probable cause is the difference in experience playing games.

\subsubsection*{Navigator Controlls}

\subsubsection*{Picking up and dropping of passengers}

\subsubsection*{Stealing Passengers}

\subsubsection*{Power-ups}

Users that played games on a regular basis were often quick to recognize and use power-ups. Most users that didn't game on a reguar basis  completely missed the presence of power-ups. Most of these users noticed the power-ups after playing for 3-4 minutes. This is also something that can be helped by putting a tutorial in the game. Once users picked up a power-up most of them were able to understand what it would do on activation, which made it easy for them to activate the power-up at the right moment.

%notes: most people seem to miss the powerups completely when playing for the first time.

\subsubsection*{Head Up Display}

The Head Up Display was generally wel received by our users. Users did not find the head up display too intrusive. They found the  information on display clear and usefull.

\subsubsection*{Sound effects}

\subsubsection*{Menu Screen}
Because the menuscreen consists of only two buttons there is little room for confusion or unclearity. The buttons function correctly and have selve-explanatory names written on them. Because of this, almost all users found our menu screen visually pleasing, clear and easy to use.

\subsubsection*{Multiplayer implementation}
The multiplayer implementation does have some shortcommings. The most striking shortcomming is the latency of the game. While the latency of the game is generally within playable limits, it sometimes tends to have a brief moment of increased latency, a so called "lagspike". Lagspikes are extremely anoying to the user because it makes the game feel unresponsive for a short duration. This can cause the user to lose (part of) the game while they should have won.
