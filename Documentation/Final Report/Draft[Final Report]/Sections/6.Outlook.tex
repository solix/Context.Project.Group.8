After delivering a product that satisfies our expectations and our end user's needs there is always room for improvement. Taxi Trouble is playable and lots of fun to play, but it still contains a few bugs. Also there are tons of features that didn't make the first release of the game which could still be implemented in the future. Implementing these will greatly increase the quality and the experience of the user who plays the game.\\

\subsection*{Bugs}
A bug is a flaw in the software. The two bugs that are present in Taxi Trouble are namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item When the Host of the game locks his phone or minimizes the game all messages stop getting through meaning that the features of the game won't work until the host resumes the game again.
\item If you want to restart the game to play again you need to completely kill the app or the game will not start correctly anymore.
\end{itemize} 
Solving these bugs will greatly increase the quality and the playability of the game.

\subsection*{Features}
Implementing a new feature's difficulty depends on the structure of your software and how much the developer understands this structure. That being said a new developer that can understand the structure of Taxi Trouble will have no problem implementing a few of the features mentioned below. A few ideas of features that we had are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choosing who you want to be in team with. Right now the game has an auto pick feature which randomly assigns people in a team.
\item Adding more collidble objects e.g. traffic, walking pedestrians, cones, etc. Adding more collidables to the map will increase the challenge of the game and the focus a player has to the game.
\item Cops. Adding this feature will make the game more immersive and realistic.
\item Health for the taxi. Colliding with objects will decrease the health of the taxi. When the taxi's health is decreased there can be a lot of side-effects e.g. the taxi's speed gets decreased, turning radius is increased, etc.
\item More powerups. A few new powerups that can be implemented are e.g. increasing the health of the taxi, slowing down other taxis, calling cops on other taxis, etc.
\end{itemize}
Adding these new feature will increase the experience a user has with the game and will ultimately make it more fun and challenging to play.
