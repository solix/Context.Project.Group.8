In the end after delivering your product most of the time everyone is happy because you achieved what has to be done, your product fulfils all requirements given and it finally works! But there is always room for improvement. Taxi Trouble is playable and is a lot of fun to play, but it still contains bugs and it still lags a bit. These are all the feature that can be improved to make the game better and achieve a more perfect end result. \\
To achieve these improvements the game must be consistently tested and maintained.
