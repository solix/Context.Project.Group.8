\section{Road map}
This section specifies the road map of the development of Taxi Trouble.
\begin{description}
\item[Design phase] \hfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Brainstorming on game concepts.
\item Choosing three best game concepts.
\item Picking one concept out of the three to develop.
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 1] \hfill \\
In this sprint we create the first working prototype.
\begin{itemize}
\item Drivable car with collisions.
\item World map.
\item On-screen buttons for controlling the car.
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 2] \hfill \\
During this sprint we focus on refactoring and research, as well as implementing the navigator screen.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing the navigator screen.
\item Refactoring all the code.
\item Researching multiplayer theory and implementation details.
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 3] \hfill \\
During this sprint we implement the basics of the multiplayer aspect of the game.
\begin{itemize}
\item Matchmaking system with a lobby and invites.
\item Team creation (pairing up navigators with drivers).
\item First start on realtime multiplayer (syncing car locations).
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 4] \hfill \\
During this sprint we start implementing the gameplay.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing basic gameplay (picking up passengers, dropping them off).
\item Refining the multiplayer (reducing lag).
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 5] \hfill \\
During this sprint we implement advanced gameplay mechanics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing advanded gameplay (car collisions and passenger stealing)
\item Further refining of the multiplayer.
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 6] \hfill \\
During this sprint we fine tune and polish the game.
\begin{itemize}
\item Fine tuning of game balance.
\item Improvement of game graphics.
\item Fixing any problems that still linger.
\item If possible: implement additional features.
\end{itemize}
\item[Sprint 7] \hfill \\
During this sprint we do user tests and we finalize the game.
\begin{itemize}
\item User testing.
\item Finalizing end product.
\end{itemize}

\section{User stories}
\subsection{Introduction}
In this section we will specify the most important user stories. In the user stories, we differentiate between the app and the game. The app what is installed on the users device and it contains the main menu, the game lobby and the actual game. The game is the actual game play, e.g. driving around in a car and navigating.

The roles 'driver' and 'navigator' are both subroles of the user role.
\subsection{User stories}
As a user\\
Given that I have installed the app\\
And I have started the app\\
Then I can create a new game lobby\\\\
As a user\\
Given that I have created a new game lobby\\
Then other users can join my game lobby\\\\
As a  user\\
Given that I am in a game lobby\\
And there is at least one other user in the lobby\\
Then I can team up with that user\\\\
As a driver\\
Given that the game has started\\
Then I can drive around the car\\\\
As a navigator\\
Given that the game has started\\
Then I can navigate around the map\\\\
As a driver\\
Given that I collide with a building\\
Then the car will bounce back\\\\
As a driver\\
Given that I stop next to a passenger\\
Then the passenger will enter my car\\\\
As a driver\\
Given that I drop off the passenger at the correct location\\
Then I will receive a point\\\\
As a driver\\
Given that I do not have a passenger\\
And I crash my car into a car that does have a passenger\\
Then I steal the passenger of the other car\\\\
As a user\\
Given that I am in the team with the most points at the end of a game\\
Then I win that game\\\\
As a navigator\\
Given that there is a power-up on the map\\
Then I can use that power-up to influence the game.\\\\
