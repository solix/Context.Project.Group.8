In this section the timeframe and the budget of the project is described. \\
The time frame that we are given for this project is 10 weeks, in which every week (starting from the third week) a working prototype is delivered. For each week this basically will take about 28 hours (1 EC) per team member. 
The next table is the timetable \footnote{Planning Games Project V2.1} given for the deliverables of our project:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|  p{5cm}| l | p{10cm}  l }

		& Emergent architecture design - Draft 1 \\ \hline
		16.05.2014 & Product vision - Final \\ \hline
		23.05.2014 & Product planning - Final \\ \hline

		\multirow{2}{*}{19.06.2014} & Emergent architecture design - Draft 2 \\ \cline{2-2}

		26.06.2014 & Input for software quality evaluation by SIG - Final version \\ \hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{20.06.2014} & Emergent architecture design - Final \\ \cline{2-2}
		& Final report - Final \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The table shows in how many days we have to finish every deliverable. At the end of each one-week sprint there should be a shippable product, i.e. a working, playable game. \\

There is no financial budget for the project, however the only things that can fall under this subject are the Android devices that we have and the ones that we can borrow to test our product and all the man hours we are going to put in the project to achieve our end product.
