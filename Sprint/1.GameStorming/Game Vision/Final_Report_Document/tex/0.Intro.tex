For each project that follows the Scrum methodology it is essential to have a clear vision of the purpose of the project. This document will provide an overview of the overall goals and requirements for the game \textbf{Taxi Trouble} that is created for the Computer Games project. This is essential as it helps the project team members to stay focussed on the most important aspects of the project, even while the details keep changing continously during the development. This is done by assessing who will be the target customers for the project and for which of their needs the product will be developed. Also what will be the most crucial elements of the project to serve the customers needs as well as possible will be defined. With these and other points it will be described how the final product will distinguish itself from the other (already existing) competing products. Finally a concise description will be given with which budget and in what timeframe the project will be developed.
