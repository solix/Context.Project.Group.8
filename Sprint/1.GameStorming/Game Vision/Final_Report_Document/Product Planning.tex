\section{User stories}
\subsection{Introduction}
In this section we will specify the most important user stories. In the user stories, we differentiate between the app and the game. The app what is installed on the users device and it contains the main menu, the game lobby and the actual game. The game is the actual game play, e.g. driving around in a car and navigating.

The roles 'driver' and 'navigator' are both subroles of the user role.
